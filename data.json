Our main goal was to build a brand that feels fun, stands out from the crowd, and shows the strong spirit of our team. In this project, we’ll take you through every step of the process. You’ll see everything from the initial sketches and wireframes to the stylescapes, version control, and detailed planning that went into the project."

My research aimed to understand why teenagers buy fast fashion, what motivates them, and why they continue despite the negative environmental and ethical impacts. <br></br> <span>How:</span> This research helped us understand that teenagers prioritize price, trends, and convenience when shopping for fast fashion, but are often unaware of the ethical and environmental issues involved. They can be influenced by marketing and education, and the main barriers they face are high costs and limited options for stylish alternatives. This deep understanding of our audience helped guide our design choices and confirmed the importance of focusing on their real needs and behaviors.",

We focused on topics like affordability, trendiness, convenience, and popular brands like Shein, Zara, and H&M. We also looked at how teens are unaware of the environmental and social impacts of fast fashion, like pollution, unethical labor, and waste. We wanted to see how education and marketing could help change their habits. The survey was designed for our target group, which is 18-24 years old. <br></br> <span>What:</span> After creating the <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScy63tSLf9eNGVDnIvFdjQIzRDAbXeSsDvIAOutSaMDYsR3XA/viewform' target='_blank'>survey<i class='fa-solid fa-arrow-right'></i></a>, we asked our teacher for feedback on the questions. She suggested adding more brands as options and rewording some questions to make them easier to understand. After making these changes, we turned the questions into a survey and added a fun QR code to attract our target group. Our teacher also confirmed that our target group was at the school, so we put the QR code on the walls to make it easier for them to take the survey. <br></br> <span>How:</span> After receiving over 19 responses, we analyzed the data. The results showed that our target group (18-24 years old) is not very aware of fast fashion’s impact. Cost was a big factor in their purchasing decisions, and many said they would buy sustainable clothing if it were cheaper. Our survey also showed that both males and females in the 18-24 age range participated, confirming that our target group was accurate. This was very helpful because it gave us valuable insights into our target audience's habits and thoughts. I would definitely use this approach again in future projects.",

This opportunity allowed me to explore 3D design and apply it to my workflow. <br></br> <span>What:</span> I took this opportunity to learn and improve my skills in sculpting 3D objects in Blender, specifically for web design applications. By creating a party animal-style character, I gained hands-on experience with sculpting tools, UV mapping, and creating realistic textures. I also explored how 3D models can be used in web design, understanding their role in creating interactive or visual elements for websites. <br></br> <span>How:</span> By practicing and refining my 3D modeling skills, I developed a deeper understanding of how 3D objects can enhance web design. This experience was valuable for my development as a front-end developer, as it allowed me to expand my technical skills in areas that are increasingly used in modern web development. ",

Frameworks are important for creating big and easy-to-maintain websites. My teacher suggested I start learning frameworks as feedback, so I decided to focus on React to understand how it works and how it fits in web development today. <br></br> <span>What:</span> I used Vite to set up a React project and worked on basic components like buttons, carousels, and text. I also learned to use React Router to navigate between pages. My teacher’s feedback helped me focus on learning the basics of React first, which is important before moving on to more advanced features. <br></br> <span>How:</span> This project helped me see how React can be used to build interactive websites. My teacher’s feedback made me realize that learning the basics is essential for improving my skills. Now I feel more confident using React and frameworks in my projects. In the future, I want to learn more about React and other frameworks to build more complex websites.",
